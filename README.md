# pam_doublecheck
A linux PAM module to require approval for logons

## Setup

### Twilio Account and Project

Before the programs can be compiled, Twilio access credentials are needed to allow sending SMS messages.

Go to https://www.twilio.com/, click "Sign Up" and create an account. Then go to https://www.twilio.com/console/projects/create and create a project. You can choose any answer for the survey.

Once you have created a project, you will see your Account SID and Auth Token.  
If you are just testing this project, you can click the "Get a trial phone number" button to get a trial number to send from.

Once you have these values, replace the example values in `secrets.h` with your values.

### Compile and Install

To use this program, run `make`. This will create the `pam_doublecheck.so` and `doublecheck` files.  

Different distributions place PAM modules in different locations. To attempt to use the default location, run `sudo make install`.

If you get errors, you can manually find where PAM modules should be installed by running the command `find / -name pam_unix.so 2>/dev/null`. You can either manually copy the `pam_doublecheck.so` file to this location or you can change the `PAM_EXPORT_PATH` path in the `Makefile` to match your distribution (set the path to the result of the find command without the "pam_unix.so" at the end) and run `sudo make install` again.

## Usage

The pam_doublecheck.so module is only an `account` type PAM module. Attempting to use it as any other type of PAM module will cause unexpected behavior.

To add pam_doublecheck to a PAM flow, insert the following line into the relevant file in `/etc/pam.d/` (e.g. `/etc/pam.d/sudo`).

```
account required pam_doublecheck.so
```

For more information on configuring PAM, see The Linux Documentation Project's [detailed guide](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/User-Authentication-HOWTO/x115.html).

## Configuration

An example completely configured PAM module configuration line:

```
account required pam_doublecheck.so verifier_group=sudo bypass_group=sudo timeout=120 verified_need_percent=0.000001 verified_need_count=1
```
